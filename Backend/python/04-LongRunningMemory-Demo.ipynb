    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### UserInfoMemory\n",
    "- Automatically extracts user name and persona from messages\n",
    "- Stores information in session state\n",
    "- Personalizes agent responses using remembered info\n",
    "- Works with both single and multi-agent conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control & Configuration\n",
    "- Per-request control via `enable_memory` flag\n",
    "- Environment variable for default behavior\n",
    "- UI toggles in frontend applications\n",
    "- Priority: Request > Environment > Default\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extraction Patterns\n",
    "- **Name**: \"My name is X\", \"I'm X\", \"Call me X\"\n",
    "- **Persona**: \"I'm a developer\", \"I work as X\", \"I'm 25\"\n",
    "- Falls back gracefully if extraction fails\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "1. **Customer Support**: Remember customer details across conversation\n",
    "2. **Personal Assistants**: Personalize suggestions based on user role\n",
    "3. **Coaching/Tutoring**: Adapt teaching style to student background\n",
    "4. **Sales**: Remember customer preferences and needs\n",
    "\n",
    "## UI Integration\n",
    "- **Main App**: Memory toggle in sidebar (App.js)\n",
    "- **HTML Demo**: memory-demo.html with live stats\n",
    "- **React Component**: MemoryToggle.jsx (reusable)\n",
    "- **Debug Tool**: memory-test.html for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Try the frontend demos to see memory in action\n",
    "- Review the **Single Agent Demo** for basic agent interaction\n",
    "- Explore the **Multiple Agents Demo** for group chat scenarios\n",
    "- Check the **Content Safety Demo** for content moderation"
